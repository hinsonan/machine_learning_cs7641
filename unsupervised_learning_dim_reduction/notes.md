## overview
2 datasets from first paper
run both clustering on original data
run all 4 algorithms on orginal data
run both clustering algorithms on the new data reduction datasets
for 1 dataset dim reduction and compare neural net performance from paper 1
run clustering and introduce these new features into the neural net (clustering labels as features,etc...) you can add these to existing features or run them on their own

## clustering details

silouete score - k means
self clustering - em
justify how your choosing K
evaluate the clusters using the labels
pairwise plot to see what features are in a cluster

## dimension reduction details

explained variance, elbow method, thresholding
evaluate the reduction 
radomized projection look at reconstruction error

## compare clustering 
original and reducted dataset
fit time change, performance change
